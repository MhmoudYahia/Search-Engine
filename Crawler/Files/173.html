Note that this Privacy Policy only applies to personal data we collect (1) on our Site, (2) through our client and supplier- facing applications and tools, (3) from communications or applications you send us, (4) when you interact with our advertising and applications on third party websites and services, if they include links to this notice; and (5) through your contractual relationship with us, as applicable. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other personal data.</p>
         <h3>Information We Collect</h3>

The personal data we process is mainly business contact information from our clients and suppliers and information you and our customers provide when using our products or accessing our websites or other applications.</p>
         <p>We also collect and collate information (including some personal data) from third party suppliers and public sources. We mainly process the personal information in order to provide our services to our customers, and to fulfill our contractual obligations and improve our products and offerings. For more information on our Processing activities, see Section 3 (Lawful Grounds for Processing) and Section 4 (How We Use Your Personal Data).</p>
         <h5>A. Personal Data that we Collect When You Use the Site</h5><br>
         <p>We collect several types of information and personal data, including data:</p>
         <ul>
          <li><span style="font-size: 10px;"> </span>that relates to an identified or identifiable individual, such as name, postal address, email address, telephone number, IP or MAC address, etc. and related information, such as the contents of an email ("personal data");</li>

          <li><span style="font-size: 10px;"> </span>about browsing history, search history, information regarding the consumers interaction with a website, application, or advertisement; and</li>
          <li><span style="font-size: 10px;"> </span>inferences drawn from any of the information identified above, such as information used to create a profile of consumer’s preferences.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>We collect this information and personal data:</p>
         <ul>

          <li><span style="font-size: 10px;"> </span>automatically as you or your employees navigate through the Site or use our products.

         </ul>
         <p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. When a user turns on DNT, the browser sends a message to websites requesting that they do not track the user. At this time, FactSet ignores these signals. FactSet does not change its practices, described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, in response to Do Not Track browser settings or signals. For information about DNT, visit www.allaboutdnt.org.</p>
         <p>Third parties may collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites, including your use of this Site.

         <p>We will indicate to you when personal data is required to enter into a contract with you (such as in anticipation of a services agreement) or to perform a contract with you (such as to provide services at your request), and when failure to provide any personal data may result in our inability to provide requested services or products.</p>
         <p>For job applicants, we may collect various types of personal data about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including:</p>
         <ul>

         <h5>C. Personal Data We Collect Through Automatic Data Collection Technologies</h5>
         <p>If you navigate through and interact with our Site and some of our products, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain usage information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns.

         <h5>D. Personal Data We Collect From Public Sources and Third Parties</h5>
         <p>In order to provide our content services to our customers, we rely on content provided by third party suppliers, as well as content that is made available to the public. Some of that content includes general information about names of directors, registered board members, managers, fund managers and other official persons of companies published on public accessible websites, letterheads, prospects, annual financial statements, invitations to shareholder meetings etc.</p>
         <p>During the job recruitment process, we may also receive personal data about you from other third parties; for example, recruiters; references from a previous employer; business partners; background check providers; as well as from publicly available sources such as social media.</p>
         <h3>Lawful Grounds for Processing</h3>
         <p>All processing and use of your personal data is justified by a "lawful ground" for processing. In the majority of cases, processing will be justified on the lawful ground that:</p>
         <ul>
          <li><span style="font-size: 10px;"> </span>the processing is necessary to perform a contract with you or take steps to enter into a contract at your request, such as to negotiate a contract with us, to fill an order, or to provide product information that you have requested;</li>
          <li><span style="font-size: 10px;"> </span>the processing is necessary for us to comply with a relevant legal obligation, such as keeping accounting records;</li>
          <li><span style="font-size: 10px;"> </span>the processing is in our legitimate interests, which are not overridden by the interests and rights of the relevant individual whose personal data is collected; and</li>
          <li><span style="font-size: 10px;"> </span>you have consented to the processing.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process personal data, those interests are:</p>
         <ul>
          <li><span style="font-size: 10px;"> </span>to use supplier, customer and website user data to conduct and develop our business activities and improve our services in order to grow our business and profitability, while limiting the use of this personal data to purposes that support the conduct and the development of our business and the improvement of our services;</li>
          <li><span style="font-size: 10px;"> </span>to use third party supplier and publicly available content (which in some instances includes personal data) in order to provide our content services to customers for their business purposes, which may include, but not be limited to taking investment decisions or compliance with applicable laws and regulations such as insider trading regulations and anti-bribery legislation, but which are for our customers to determine and explain in their privacy notices.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>How We Use Your Personal Data</h3>

         <p style="padding-left: 0in;">If your application for employment with FactSet is successful, you will be provided with a separate notice during your on-boarding process, which will provide you with additional information.</p>
         <p>We reserve the right to disclose, share, or otherwise transfer personal data and usage information in connection with a proposed or actual corporate merger, acquisition, consolidation, the sale of a portion of our business or the sale of substantially all of our assets, or other fundamental corporate change, whatever form it may take. In the event that there is a change of ownership or control of your personal data or usage information, we will post a prominent notice to that effect on our Site.</p>
         <h3>Transferring Personal Data</h3>
         <p>FactSet is a global organization headquartered in the United States, and we may need to transfer your personal data to third party suppliers and to our affiliates for the purposes described above. If your personal data is subject to the GDPR and is transferred outside the EU to other FactSet affiliates or to third party service providers, we will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives the same level of protection as if it remained within the EU, including by entering into data transfer agreements using the European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses, or by relying on certification schemes. For transfers of personal data among FactSet affiliates we have put in place European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses and have entered into an Intragroup data transfer agreement. You have a right to obtain details of the mechanism under which your personal data is transferred outside of the EU, although please note that we may need to redact copies of transfer agreements for reasons of commercial confidentiality, provided that you can retain access to the relevant safeguards.</p>
         <p>With respect to the information you provide to us through the recruitment or employment process, we may share and transfer your data with other members of the FactSet Group located globally (including in countries outside EU/EEA, such as the United States of America, India and the Philippines). FactSet has adopted an Intra-Group Data Transfer Agreement to ensure your personal data receives an adequate level of protection wherever it is processed within the FactSet group.</p>
         <p>FactSet reserves the right to share any information that you provide which is not deemed personal data or is not otherwise subject to contractual restrictions.</p>
         <h3>Retention of Your Personal Data</h3>
         <p>We keep personal data only for as long as required to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected. In general, we retain personal data for a period of time corresponding to a statute of limitation, for example to maintain an accurate record of customer and supplier dealings. However, in some circumstances we may retain personal data for other periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax or accounting requirements, or if required to do so by a legal process, legal authority, or other governmental entity having authority to make the request, for so long as required in accordance with our document retention policy.</p>
         <p>With respect to personal data we obtain from job applicants through the recruitment process, our general approach is to retain your application for a period of 6 months or, where you consent to a longer period of retention, for up to 2 years following the closure of the recruitment process for the role you applied for. Otherwise, you should note that, in certain cases, legal or regulatory obligations require us to retain specific records for a set period of time. If you accept employment with FactSet, your personal data will be held on the basis set out in our Employee Data Privacy Notice, which will be shared with you following your hiring.</p>
         <h3>Your Rights</h3>
         <p>You may have certain rights in connection with the personal data we collect from you or that you provide to us. Depending on where you reside, these rights may be specifically provided to you by statute. We will take steps in accordance with applicable legislation to keep personal data accurate, complete, and up to date.</p>
         <p>Specifically, you may be entitled to exercise the below rights in connection with your personal data:</p>
         <ul>
          <li><span style="font-size: 10px;"> </span>Request that FactSet disclose our collection and use of your personal data during the past 12 months;</li>
          <li><span style="font-size: 10px;"> </span>Request that we provide your personal data to you in structured, commonly used and machine-readable format;</li>
          <li><span style="font-size: 10px;"> </span>Request that we correct any inadequate, incomplete, or incorrect personal data we hold;</li>
          <li><span style="font-size: 10px;"> </span>Request that we delete your personal data;</li>
          <li><span style="font-size: 10px;"> </span>Request that we restrict processing of your personal data;</li>
          <li><span style="font-size: 10px;"> </span>Object to processing or withdraw your consent for processing (including profiling) based on legitimate interest lawful grounds, without affecting the lawfulness of processing before withdrawal;</li>
          <li><span style="font-size: 10px;"> </span>Object to direct marketing&nbsp;(including profiling); or</li>
          <li><span style="font-size: 10px;"> </span>File a complaint with the applicable supervisory authority.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Additionally, job applicants specifically have the following rights with respect to personal data:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>Withdraw your consent at any time; for example, if you are no longer happy for us to retain your unsuccessful application for an extended period of up to 2 years;</li>
          <li>Request that we restrict our processing of your personal data where: 
           <ul>
            <li>you contest the accuracy of the personal data until we have taken sufficient steps to correct or verify its accuracy;</li>
            <li>where the processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase the personal data;</li>
            <li>where we no longer need your personal data for the purposes of the processing, but you require such personal data for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims; or</li>
            <li>where you have objected to processing justified on legitimate interest grounds (see below) pending verification as to whether FactSet has compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing.</li>
           </ul></li>
         </ul>
         <p>Note that we will not discriminate against you in any way if you choose to exercise any of the above rights. Please contact us as indicated in the Contact Us section below or using the email-address: dataprivacy@factset.com if you wish to exercise any of your rights, or if you have any enquiries or complaints regarding the processing of your personal data.</p>
         <p>We may need to request additional information from you in order to respond to your request to exercise any of the above rights. We will respond to your verifiable request and to take action with respect to your request within 45 days. If we require additional time to disclose and or delete your personal information as provided under applicable law, we will inform you within 45 days of your request.</p>
         <p>To the extent allowed under applicable law, FactSet may decline to comply with certain data deletion requests in the event that your personal data is required to:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>Complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected, provide a good or service requested by you, or reasonably anticipated within the context of a business’s ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform a contract between FactSet and you;</li>
          <li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; or prosecute those responsible for that activity;</li>
          <li>Debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;</li>
          <li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise his or her right of free speech, or exercise another right provided for by law;</li>
          <li>Comply with applicable laws or legal obligations;</li>
          <li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when our deletion of that information is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement to that research, if you have provided informed consent;</li>
          <li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your relationship with us; or</li>
          <li>Otherwise use your personal information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which you provided information.</li>

         <p>This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act of 2015 and constitutes FactSet’s group slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 August 2021.</p>
         <h3>Introduction from Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer</h3>
         <p>As a global software and solutions provider, we are committed to combatting slavery and human trafficking. Our employees are expected to report concerns using the appropriate reporting channels, and management are expected to escalate and/or address these concerns immediately. We are proud of the corporate social responsibility work we carry out in our local communities around the world. As we expand into new markets, we ensure that corporate social responsibility is an integral part of our business development plans.</p>
         <h3>Organisation's Structure and Business</h3>
         <p>We are a major supplier of online-integrated financial and economic information to the investment management and banking industries. FactSet Research Systems Inc. is the parent company of all our global subsidiaries, including our businesses in the United Kingdom (“FactSet”). FactSet has approximately 10,892 employees worldwide in 37 office locations in 20 countries.</p>
         <h3>Our Supply Chains</h3>
         <p>FactSet is not in an industry with a high risk of modern slavery or human trafficking. Our supply chains include suppliers based throughout the world that provide a range of services and products, from third party data to IT infrastructure and local food service. FactSet is committed to high professional standards and business ethics, and we expect the same from our suppliers. All suppliers are expected to comply with applicable local and national laws, policies and regulations.</p>
         <h3>Our Values and Policies</h3>
         <p>Part of our values and culture is that we are an inclusive community, working together as a team and staying connected to our clients and each other. We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. As such, we have implemented our own FactSet Supply Chain Code of Conduct, available on our public website. We expect our global suppliers and their respective supply chains to uphold similar standards of ethics and to act in accordance with the FactSet Supply Chain Code of Conduct. This demonstrates our support and commitment to act ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships. We seek to implement and enforce effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in our supply chains.</p>
         <p>Our Human Rights Policy is available on our public website and demonstrates our commitment to develop due diligence to identify and prevent human rights risks to people in our business and value chain. Where we identify adverse human rights impacts resulting from or caused by our business activities, we are committed to providing for or cooperating in their fair and equitable remediation.</p>
         <h3>Employees</h3>
         <p>Giving back to our communities is an integral part of our culture. FactSet continues to invest in local communities through its Corporate Responsibility program, uniting around our four Pillars of Service: Inspire Tomorrow’s Engineers, Educate to Elevate, Protect Our Environment, and Alleviate Food Insecurity. The program is led by a global team and supported by local Corporate Responsibility (CR) Committees who engage colleagues in strategic service projects to make a difference in our local communities. During fiscal 2021, FactSet offered a fully virtual employee volunteer program by transitioning to remote mentoring and other educational support programs, as well as offering new virtual learning and engagement opportunities for young people. In total, FactSet delivered 263 volunteer events globally in 20 countries and 32 FactSet locations. FactSet employees and volunteers served nearly 11,000 volunteer roles and over 14,000 total volunteer hours.</p>
         <p>Through global campaigns with strategic nonprofit partners, FactSet employees achieved far-ranging impacts. During fiscal 2021, FactSet supported the community by:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>helping over 80,000 young people gain qualifications, higher education, or employment;</li>
          <li>providing over 1 million meals to people in need;</li>
          <li>enabling the planting of over 14,000 trees;</li>
          <li>creating over 100,000 data points to support environmental research and disaster relief.</li>
         </ul>

         <p><span style="color: black;">Our 2021 Sustainability Report is available on our public website and details how we manage our global business through our fair and transparent governance processes and equip our staff to uphold the highest standards of ethics.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color: black;">Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on our public website and applies to all employees globally and embodies fundamental principles of ethical and legal conduct to ensure we continue to be guided by our values. The Code helps all employees navigate the highly complex, regulated, and challenging global business environment in which we operate, and ensures that our sense of integrity is at the forefront of each business transaction. All employees are required to affirm and recertify their commitment to the Code on an annual basis. Mandatory new hire and compliance training programs educate our employees on how to conduct business in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color: black;">If employees have any concerns about any potential wrongdoing or violations of law, these issues can be raised through appropriate channels. In situations where employees prefer to make an anonymous or confidential report, they are encouraged to use FactSet’s Ethics Action Line which is accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in multiple languages, at </span><span style="color: blue;">www.FactSetEthicsActionLine.com </span><span style="color: black;">and on our intranet site. Our Whistleblower and Anti- Retaliation Policy supports the confidential, anonymous submission of reports of suspected misconduct and prohibits retaliation against any individual for reporting a concern in good faith or participating in the investigation of a concern reported by someone else.</span></p>
         <h3>Next Steps</h3>
         <p>We will continue to review the effectiveness of the steps we have taken to protect against slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains. In addition, we will continue to evaluate and assess emerging risks, if any arise, regarding possible human rights abuses among our suppliers.</p>

         <p><strong><span>Financial year ending August 31, 2023</span></strong></p>
         <p>FactSet Research Systems Inc. (the “Company” or “FactSet”) is a multinational company headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, United States with operations across 23 countries. FactSet was founded in 1978 and provides integrated financial information and analytical applications for the global investment community.</p>
         <h3><strong>Introduction to FactSet’s UK Tax Strategy</strong></h3>
         <p>FactSet has substantial local operations and presence in the UK. FactSet is committed to conduct its tax affairs in accordance with the following objectives:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>Act as a responsible global corporate tax citizen in compliance with applicable tax law, regulations and reporting disclosure requirements;</li>
          <li>Maintain an open relationship with tax authorities based on collaboration and integrity;</li>
          <li>Apply diligence and care in the management of processes and procedures by which all tax related activities are undertaken;</li>
          <li>Encourage ethical and transparent business practices;</li>
          <li>Use available incentives and reliefs while ensuring that these reliefs are not used for purposes which are knowingly contradictory to the intent of the legislation.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3><strong>Risk Management and Governance</strong></h3>
         <p>FactSet believes that it is important to pay the correct amount of tax at the right time, under all relevant laws and regulations. We are committed to provide transparent and accessible information to tax administrators in order to facilitate an understanding of our tax strategy and the underlying business models. We operate an effective tax control framework to identify key tax risks and to manage those risks through appropriately designed and operated controls, polices and processes.</p>
         <h3>Tax Strategy and Strategic Objectives</h3>
         <p>Generally, FactSet’s tax strategy and strategic objectives are intended to establish a clear and unequivocal approach to all aspects of tax reporting and compliance.<br><br>
          Our strategy is focused on ensuring that taxes (and tax risks) are managed to provide outcomes consistent with commercial reality and are within the parameters of our strategic objectives. The strategy also requires that all tax obligations are complied with in the UK and all other relevant jurisdictions.<br><br>
          With the tax landscape constantly changing, FactSet’s tax affairs and tax risk management procedures are regularly reviewed to ensure that processes and measures are up-to-date so that we are able to identify, assess, manage and mitigate tax risk as well as remain aligned with FactSet’s business strategy and governance framework.</p>
         <h3><strong>Level of Acceptable Tax Risk</strong></h3>
         <p>We aim for certainty on the tax positions we adopt, so diligent professional care and judgment is employed to assess tax risks arising from our commercial operations. We seek to reduce the level of tax risk arising from operations as far as is practically reasonable through an ongoing commitment to improving internal control effectiveness and by ensuring that all tax or tax-related processes are allocated to appropriately qualified owners.<br><br>
          FactSet’s level of acceptable risk is low, and we structure our affairs based on sound commercial principles and in accordance with company policy and relevant tax legislation. FactSet will consider different tax outcomes when considering how to undertake commercially motivated transactions, but does not participate in aggressive tax planning for the purposes of tax avoidance or engage in tax schemes that go against the intention of the legislative authority.</p>
         <h3><strong>Approach towards Dealings with HM Revenue &amp; Customs (“HMRC”)</strong></h3>
         <p>It is FactSet’s general policy to be transparent and proactive in all interactions with HMRC.</p>
         <p>We have an open, honest and positive working relationship with HMRC. We are committed to prompt disclosure and transparency in all tax matters with HMRC. We recognize that there will be areas of differing legal interpretations between ourselves and HMRC and where this occurs we will engage in proactive discussion to bring matters to as rapid a conclusion as possible.</p>

         <h2 id="form-header-widget_1614702905665" style="margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:25px;">FactSet Research Systems Inc. Supply Chain Code of Conduct</h2><a id="Supply-Chain-Code-of-Conduct" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
         <p>At FactSet Research Systems Inc. (inclusive of all of its subsidiaries, “FactSet”), we are guided by our values. All of our employees, officers and directors commit to a <a href="https://investor.factset.com/static-files/4a3eb5dc-c13f-447d-982c-a612e603e0ca">Code of Business Conduct and Ethics</a> that embodies our fundamental principles of ethical and legal conduct. In keeping with our values, we expect all of our global suppliers (“Suppliers”) and their respective supply chains to uphold similar standards of ethics and conduct and to act in accordance with this FactSet Supply Chain Code of Conduct (the “Code”).</p>
         <p>This Code outlines the minimum standards that all of our Suppliers are expected to adhere to. All Suppliers are expected to conduct their business activities in full compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. This Code is not and should not be interpreted to circumvent or undermine any applicable laws, rules, or regulations. Any Supplier who is unable to comply with this Code should immediately notify FactSet. Failure to comply with this Code may result in FactSet taking specific action, including but not limited to the disqualification of future opportunities and the withdrawal of business.</p>
         <h5>FactSet’s Core Sourcing Principles</h5>
         <p>We consider the following factors when selecting our Suppliers:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>High quality products and services that fit our business needs;</li>
          <li>Best value, meeting our financial requirements without compromising on quality or customer service;</li>
          <li>Successful completion of our data security assessment and architecture review;</li>
          <li>Legal compliance and contractual terms in line with FactSet’s standards and all applicable laws and regulations; and</li>
          <li>Business practices consistent with applicable laws, rules and regulations, this Code, and whenever practicable, FactSet’s environmental, social and governance philosophies.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5>Ethical Business Practices</h5>
         <p>FactSet seeks to excel while operating honestly and ethically, never through taking unfair advantage of others. FactSet prohibits fraudulent or corrupt business practices and any conduct of a suspicious, unethical, or illegal nature. Suppliers shall ensure their senior management oversees, monitors, flows down and implements policies, procedures, and guidelines to ensure compliance with law and demonstrate a commitment to business ethics, social justice, environmental and climate action, and strong corporate governance. FactSet suppliers shall work to ensure accountability, transparency, fairness, and responsibility for internal and external stakeholders and other affected or interested parties.</p>
         <p>Our Suppliers must be transparent in their business dealings and timely in regulatory reporting. Suppliers may not engage in bribery, corruption, embezzlement, extortion, or other illegitimate and unethical business practices. Suppliers must comply with all applicable laws relating to anti-corruption and anti-bribery. Suppliers must avoid unlawful agreements or arrangements with their competitors and comply with applicable fair competition laws. FactSet will not support, facilitate, or condone money laundering, tax evasion or any other illegal conduct by Suppliers and will assist governmental authorities, where appropriate, in preventing illegal activities involving FactSet.</p>
         <h5>Human Rights/Workers’ Rights and Diversity</h5>
         <p>FactSet believes in the fundamental responsibility to respect international human rights standards (see our <a href="https://investor.factset.com/static-files/a91156f8-e34c-46af-a19d-9ef763005b4b">Human Rights Policy</a>). FactSet expects its Suppliers to share its commitment to human rights and equal opportunity in the workplace. Suppliers must commit to upholding the human rights of their workers in accordance with this Code, the principles and guidelines of the International Labor Organization and the United Nations, and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.</p>
         <p>Suppliers must ensure that all of their employees have chosen their employment freely without duress. Their employees must work in safe, healthy and humane working conditions. Employees must be provided with fair wages and benefits relative to the market, and none of our Suppliers should expect their employees to exceed fair working hours as designated by applicable local and international law. Suppliers shall respect the right of freedom of association of their employees and the right to collective bargaining.</p>
         <p>All of our Suppliers must ensure that they do not have within any part of their own operations or their supply-chain any form of child labor or human rights violations. FactSet is committed to ensuring there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business and FactSet will not knowingly support or conduct business with any organization involved in slavery or human trafficking (see our <a href="https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Website_Misc/Website_Privacy%20and%20Legal/modern%20slavery%20statement%202019%20final.pdf">Modern Slavery Act Statement</a>).</p>
         <p>Suppliers must be committed to a workforce free of harassment and discrimination. We expect our Suppliers to take diversity and inclusion in their workplaces seriously and demonstrate a commitment to equality of opportunity for individuals and groups, with no tolerance for discrimination or workplace harassment. We urge our Suppliers to recruit, hire, develop, promote and discipline employees without regard to race, sex, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, national origin, citizenship, marital status, pregnancy, disability, or veteran status, providing reasonable accommodations where necessary to ensure fairness and non-discrimination.</p>
         <h5>Environment and Sustainability</h5>
         <p>FactSet recognizes its social responsibility to protect the environment and operate its business sustainably. FactSet expects its Suppliers to adhere to responsible environmental management and to operate their business in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Suppliers should strive to minimize negative environmental impact as far as is practical and possible. We urge our Suppliers to target reductions in their carbon footprints, reduce their levels of waste and where possible incorporate reduction, re-use and recycling measures in their business operations.</p>
         <h5>Third Party Intellectual Property, Proprietary and Privacy Rights</h5>
         <p>FactSet respects the intellectual property, proprietary and privacy rights of third parties and expects its Suppliers to do the same. Any Supplier given access to FactSet data, including confidential, sensitive, proprietary data or personal information of FactSet employees, clients, business partners or others, must carefully safeguard and protect that data from unauthorized disclosure. When Suppliers are properly given the right to use such assets, they must use them responsibly. Suppliers must respect the privacy of their customers, employees, and other data subjects, and comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations.</p>
         <h5>Monitoring Compliance and Reporting Concerns</h5>
         <p>Suppliers are expected to self-monitor their compliance with this Code while conducting business and to have appropriate internal controls and management systems in place. FactSet may request reasonable audits or information to confirm compliance with this Code by our Suppliers. If you are aware or concerned that someone has violated this Code, please report your concern to our Chief Compliance Officer at <a href="mailto:dataprivacy@factset.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-safelink="true" data-linkindex="1">dataprivacy@factset.com</a>&nbsp;or anonymously through the FactSet Ethics Action Line at <a href="https://FactSetEthicsActionline.com">https://FactSetEthicsActionline.com</a>. Reports will be kept confidential to the fullest extent possible, consistent with law and the need to conduct an adequate review. FactSet prohibits retaliation against any individual or company for having made a complaint in good faith, regardless of whether the complaint is ultimately substantiated.</p>

         <p>FactSet Research Systems Inc. and its subsidiaries (“FactSet” or the “Company”) have adopted the following Global Procurement Diversity Policy (“Policy”).</p>
         <h4>I. FACTSET’S POLICY</h4>
         <p>FactSet is committed to developing mutually beneficial business relationships with a variety of suppliers, including minority-owned, women-owned, disability-owned, veteran-owned and/or LGBTQ+-owned business enterprises (“Diverse Suppliers”). The primary goal of this policy and FactSet’s Supplier Diversity Program is to provide greater access and opportunities to those diverse suppliers that meet the Company’s procurement and contractual standards.</p>
         <p>FactSet employees are encouraged to proactively identify and include Diverse Suppliers in the procurement process. Those that are competitively priced, that offer high-quality goods and services, and that satisfy our procurement and contractual standards should be included in our sourcing and procurement process. This policy reflects the Company’s desire to create an opportunity for Diverse Suppliers to market their products and services to FactSet and to encourage FactSet employees to offer opportunities to such suppliers. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
         <h4>II. APPLICATION OF THE POLICY</h4>
         <p>The Policy applies to all transactions to procure goods or services to which FactSet is a party, regardless of whether they have been drafted by FactSet or a third party, and provides socially- and economically-disadvantaged businesses with an equitable opportunity to compete as a supplier in acquisitions of goods and services conducted in bidding procedures, as referenced in the Global Procurement and Contracting Policy, to the extent that the opportunity is consistent with contract performance.</p>
         <h4>III. POLICY</h4>
         <ol>
          <li>FactSet encourages the use of Diverse Suppliers, including those with the designations noted in “Definitions” (see Appendix), for product and service purchases, provided that such suppliers demonstrate the ability to meet FactSet’s Contract requirements.&nbsp;<br><br></li>
          <li>Supplier Diversity. The Procurement function’s Supplier Diversity department will work in conjunction with key stakeholders to promote the participation of Diverse Suppliers in FactSet’s procurement process. Such coordinated activities include, but are not limited to:</li>
         </ol>
         <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
          <li>Attend, participate or support supplier events that to engage with and encourage participation with Diverse Suppliers;</li>
          <li>Educate Diverse Suppliers about the competitive bidding process and opportunities for obtaining Contracts;</li>
          <li>Promote consideration of Diverse Suppliers in the purchasing process;</li>
          <li>Ensure organization has access to supplier diversity classifications for competitive bidding process;</li>
          <li>Work with key stakeholders to prioritize spend categories, develop and publish diversity spend targets;</li>
          <li>Seek out certified Diverse Suppliers that can provide competitive, high-quality goods and services;</li>
          <li>Communicate the value of supplier diversity both internally and externally to all stakeholders; and</li>
          <li>Report supplier diversity data/information as required and to the extent permissible under applicable laws.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>To ensure equity and fairness, the formal competitive bidding process, as outlined in the Global Procurement and Contracting Policy, should include the consideration of Diverse Suppliers. &nbsp;Requisitioner shall consult with an appropriate Procurement representative to identify diverse supplier(s) for the required spend category. Procurement representatives may consult Workday to identify Diverse Suppliers with the noted diversity tags, as defined in the &nbsp;“Key Terms and Definitions” (see Appendix).</p>
